  {
    id: 'what-is',
    question: 'What is a microchip?',
    answer: 'A microchip is a tiny electronic chip (about the size of a grain of rice) that is implanted under your pet\'s skin, typically between the shoulder blades. It contains a unique identification number that can be read by a scanner.'
  },
  {
    id: 'how-works',
    question: 'How does it work?',
    answer: 'When a scanner is passed over the microchip, it emits a radio frequency that powers the chip, causing it to transmit the unique ID number. This number is then looked up in a database to find the owner\'s contact information.'
  },
  {
    id: 'does-it-hurt',
    question: 'Does it hurt my pet?',
    answer: 'The implantation process is similar to a routine vaccination and causes only brief, minimal discomfort. No anesthesia is required, and most pets don\'t react to the procedure.'
  },
  {
    id: 'battery',
    question: 'Does it need a battery?',
    answer: 'No, microchips are passive devices with no battery. They only activate when scanned, which is why they last for the pet\'s entire lifetime without needing replacement.'
  },
  {
    id: 'gps',
    question: 'Can it track my pet\'s location?',
    answer: 'No, a standard microchip is not a GPS tracker. It only stores an ID number that can be read when scanned. For real-time tracking, you would need a separate GPS collar device.'
  },
  {
    id: 'cost',
    question: 'How much does it cost?',
    answer: 'Microchipping typically costs between $25-$50, including registration. Many shelters and clinics offer low-cost or free microchipping events. This one-time fee provides lifetime identification.'
  },
  {
    id: 'register',
    question: 'Do I need to register the microchip?',
    answer: 'Yes! Registration is crucial. The microchip is useless if it\'s not registered with your current contact information in a pet recovery database. Always update your information when you move or change phone numbers.'
  },
  {
    id: 'update',
    question: 'How do I update my information?',
    answer: 'Contact the microchip registry where your pet is registered (your vet can tell you which one). You can usually update your information online through the registry\'s website or by phone.'
