   - Add booking management
   - Implement payment processing

3. **Search**:
   - Add geocoding for accurate distance calculation
   - Implement map view with markers
   - Add real-time availability checking
   - Implement advanced filtering

4. **Security**:
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add input sanitization
   - Set up proper environment variables

## Running the Application

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Access the application:

## Important Notes

1. **Demo Mode**: This is a demonstration system. All authentication accepts any credentials, and all data is stored in browser localStorage.

2. **Protected Routes**: Provider registration and dashboard require authentication. Users are redirected to sign-in if not authenticated.

3. **Provider Uniqueness**: A user can only register as a provider once. The system checks for existing providers by userId.

4. **Data Persistence**: Data persists in localStorage until browser storage is cleared.

5. **Search Functionality**: Search works by filtering sample data. In production, this should use a proper search service.

6. **Booking Feature**: The booking button shows a "coming soon" alert. This feature needs to be implemented separately.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time chat between customers and providers
- Calendar integration for scheduling
- Payment processing integration
- Photo upload for providers
- Real review and rating system
- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- Background check verification
- Insurance verification
- Cancellation policies
- Refund management
